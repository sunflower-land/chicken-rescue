# ‚öñÔ∏è No Licence

The previous version was used unethically on other Blockchains. The team is working on deciding the licence that will best suit our community. Until then, the code falls under No Licence and cannot be reused.

All media assets (images and music) are not available for use in commercial or private projects.

To access the crops, resources and land tiles, please refer to the [SunnySide Asset Pack](https://danieldiggle.itch.io/sunnyside)
